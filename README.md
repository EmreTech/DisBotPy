## Installing

First off, before installing DisBotPy, you should know that it is VERY EXPERIMENTAL right now and issues are prone to happen.

DisBotPy is not in PyPi right now, so you'll have to manually install from the repository.

Make sure you have `git` installed before doing this.

Run this command in a terminal:

```bash
# For Unix systems
python3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/EmreTech/DisBotPy
```

If you're using Windows, then you'll have to search up how to do this.
